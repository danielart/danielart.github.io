## 2024-05-23 - Back to Top Button
**Learning:** For long single-page portfolios, users often lose context or easy access to navigation after scrolling deep into content (like certifications or experience).
**Action:** Implemented a non-intrusive "Back to Top" button that only appears after significant scrolling (500px). Used glassmorphism to match the design system so it feels integrated, not tacked on. Added keyboard focus management to return focus to the top logo, improving accessibility for keyboard users who would otherwise be stranded at the bottom of the DOM.
