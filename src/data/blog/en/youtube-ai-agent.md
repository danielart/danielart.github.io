description: How an AI agent multiplied YouTube views in a real musical project. From overwhelmed worker to orchestra conductor.

📈 The YouTube Short I uploaded following my AI agent's instructions has 10 times more views than the ones I made with love.

I work full-time, program, study, have a daughter and 4 dogs. Also, I play in a pop rock band as a bassist and guitarist (anything but singing). 🎸 To be honest, I get overwhelmed just reading it, but it's not that bad.

I created a custom Gem in Gemini with a single purpose: to automate the group's social media content because I didn't have the time or energy to do it with quality. As musicians, we want to make music, not be thinking about what to upload to social media.

I injected it with real data from our audience (taken from APIs and screenshots in bulk, and processed by Gemini) so it could tune the strategy and start executing. I only expected to do things faster and without thinking, but it turns out it also works better.

The first video where I followed its instructions to the letter (title, trend, editing, hashtags) has 10 times more views than the ones I did by hand.

AI allows me to do things for which I didn't have time or continuity. Before, I didn't even consider posting. Now, it motivates me to do it just to see how to improve the Gem's brain, providing it with more knowledge and strategies that I research with NotebookLM.

I've gone from overwhelmed worker to orchestra conductor, without going through cheap marketing courses. Creativity is still mine (for now); optimized execution is hers.

👇 If you have a band or manage a community and want the Gem's instructions, tell me in the comments of the [original post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7420224000468930560-dZvF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAyGEyEBSxx7QKU1cYLp8wTYjaf-v0rmmww) and I'll send them to you.
