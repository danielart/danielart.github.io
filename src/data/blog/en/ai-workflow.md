description: How to orchestrate an ecosystem of AI tools to accelerate application development from months to days.

I've gone from taking two months to make a test App (or not even starting it knowing I wouldn't have time) to having it ready in a matter of days. Pay attention.

I no longer program alone; now I orchestrate an ecosystem of tools with AI in parallel.

First, I talk to **Gemini** to discuss the idea. I ask it to question me, to make me think, to look for references, and to analyze strengths and weaknesses. It's my strategic "sparring".

Then, I open **Google Stitch** for the design. Meanwhile, I use **Antigravity** to define the roadmap with the AI, install the boilerplate, and start writing code with its agent. Before going to bed, I pass clear tasks to **Google Jules** (or send him the screens to implement from Stitch) and he takes care of creating the MRs during the night.

In addition, thanks to **MCPs** (Stitch, Context7, Firebase, Playwright, Github...), workflows, tasks, and skills... production deployments, builds, and translations have gone from being a headache to a simple guided process. No more suffering setting up a thousand things following infinite tutorials.

## What has changed for me?

- **Multitasking:** I always have 3 or 4 processes in parallel. It's a greater mental effort, but the results are exponential.
- **Goodbye micro-heart attacks:** Build errors and cloud consoles no longer cause heart attacks; the AI guides me step by step.
- **Speed:** POCs (Proofs of Concept) that used to take me weeks are now ready to test in 48 hours.
- **Entry barrier:** Before I discarded ideas for lack of time; now, I simply go for it.
- **Joy:** In the end, the best thing is to regain the thrill of seeing how an idea becomes tangible without burning out in the process. We've all felt that paralysis of having a good idea and not knowing where to get the hours; now we have a "free" advisor for almost everything.

And now I'm just thinking: should I add **Moltbot** to be able to request developments in Antigravity via WhatsApp while walking the dogs? Purely for fun... and to see how far this goes.
